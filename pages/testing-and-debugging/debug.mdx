# Debug

While not strictly tests, the `debug` folder contains several useful scripts that provide clarity on the solution's internals and help with working on the solution.

## Running Debug Scripts

Run these scripts using:

```bash
bun run test/debug/FILE_NAME.ts
```

- `decompile.ts` - Initial PoC for a decompiler for VM commands.
- `deploy.ts` - Example verifier deployment to a locally run `anvil` node.
- `play.ts`
- `speed.ts` - Speed test for the `getStorage` and `getProof` methods of the  `EthProver`.
- `zkevm.ts` - Demonstrates Polygon zkEVM lack of `eth_getProof` support.

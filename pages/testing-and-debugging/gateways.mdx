# Gateways

The `gateway` folder holds individual test files for each of the [chains](/chains) that we support.

Each file deploys a Solidity contract (`SlotDataReader.sol`) to a locally running `anvil` node that executes a series of predefined `GatewayRequest`s against a helper contract (`SlotDataContract.sol`) deployed to the network in question. The contract includes properties that test the many complex storage rules outlined in the Solidity documentation: [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

## Running Tests

Run the tests for a particular chain using:

```bash
bun test test/gateway/FILE_NAME.test.ts
```

The chains for which we have defined tests are:

```bash
arb1.test.ts
base-sepolia.test.ts
base.test.ts
blast.test.ts
fraxtal.test.ts
linea.test.ts
op.test.ts
polygon-pos.test.ts
scroll.test.ts
taiko.test.ts
zksync.test.ts
zora.test.ts
```

Each file extends from tests.ts to implement the predefined tests consistently across chains.

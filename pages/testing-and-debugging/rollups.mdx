# Rollups

While not strictly tests, these TypeScript files offer useful debugging information for the [`Rollup`](/architecture#the-rollup) class implementations (in the context of our solution architecture) for each of the supported chains.

## Running Tests

Running these scripts will output details of the default rollup configuration as well as the most recent commits for the chain in question.

Run the script for a particular chain using:

```bash
bun run test/rollup/FILE_NAME.test.ts
```

We have debug scripts for the following chains:

```bash
arb1.ts
base.ts
linea.ts
op.ts
polygon-pos.ts
scroll.ts
taiko.ts
zksync.ts
```

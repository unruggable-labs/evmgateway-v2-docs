# Provers

Different chains implement their account and storage tries differently and/or expose different endpoints or proofing formats through JSON-RPC. The `provers` folder holds tests for the different proving systems that are utilized by the solution.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following command:

```bash
bun test  test/provers/FILE_NAME.test.t
```

There are tests for:

```bash

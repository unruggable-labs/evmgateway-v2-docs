# Examples

The pages contained within this section of the documentation outline conceptually (with code snippets) how to write a virtual machine request (`EVMRequest`) to read and verify data from another blockchain.

For example, there are pages outlining how to:

- [Read value types](/examples/reading-value-types)
- [Read from a Struct](/examples/reading-structs)
- [Read from a mapping](/examples/reading-from-a-mapping)

In addition to these examples, we maintain a repository of [gateway examples](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/gateway-examples) that have simple, documented examples that can be run with a single line of code. For example:

```bash
bun tsx examples/6-keccak-of-concat-as-key-with-debug.ts
``` 

These example utilise our npm package [@unruggable/evmgateway](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unruggable/evmgateway) which offers a quick and easy way to get started with our codebase.

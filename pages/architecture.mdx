# Architecture

The [v2 EVM Gateway codebase](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) includes both a [Typescript](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/src/vm.ts) and a [Solidity](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/contracts/EVMProver.sol) version of the virtual machine. The idea is simple: write your code in Typescript to read data from your chosen Layer 2 (L2) network, then easily convert it to Solidity and deploy it without changes.

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)

1.	**Contract Definition**: A contract defines an `EVMRequest`. This request is passed to the fetch method defined in `EVMFetchTarget.sol`.
2.	**Offchain Data Handling**: The fetch method uses the [ERC-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) standard and reverts with an `OffchainLookup`, instructing the client to query the Gateway.
3.	**Response Processing**: The `fetchCallback` method processes the response, using a chain-specific "Verifier" to validate proofs and return the results to the caller.

## Core Components

### 1. Request Builder

- `EVMFetcher.sol` provides a [public API](/op-code-reference) for creating an `EVMRequest`. This request consists of a series of operations that the virtual machine interprets to read and process data from other blockchains.
- Solidity developers can write contracts that build these requests by inheriting from `EVMFetchTarget.sol`.
- A Typescript version is also available for easier development and testing. You can check out our [Examples](/examples) page for more details.

### 2. The Gateway

- The `gateway.ts` Typescript file sets up a simple HTTP server to handle requests for data from other blockchains. It uses a “Rollup” as a parameter (explained below).
- The gateway connects to the necessary blockchain to gather data, create proofs, and send them back to the client, so users don’t have to interact directly with the blockchains.

### 3. The Rollup

- Rollup classes in Typescript use “Prover” and “Commit” generics to instruct the Gateway on how to request data and create verifiable proofs.
- They have methods (`encodeWitness` and `encodeWitnessV1`) that explain how to encode proof data from the gateway in a way that is understood by the "Verifier".


#### Commits

- Commits represent the data submitted to Layer 1 (L1) by the L2 chain. They are necessary to verify a proof or extract the right data to check against a proof.
- The `rollup.ts` base class defines methods to help the gateway fetch commit data (`fetchLatestCommitIndex` and `fetchCommit`).


### 4. Verifiers

- A Verifier is a Solidity contract deployed on L1. It is used by the ERC 3668 callback to verify the data sent from the gateway server.
- Different chains utilize different hashing functions and Trie structures. Verifiers use different verification steps based on the blockchain. Helper contracts are used include `EthTrieHooks.sol` and `LineaTrieHooks.sol`.

#### Gateway URL

- The Verifier specifies the URLs of the Gateways to query for handling a request via the `gatewayURLs()` method.

#### Context

- Each Verifier implements the `getLatestContext` method from the `IEVMVerifier` interface. This method determines what L2 chain state the request can access. The gateway considers this context when responding and includes it in its response.

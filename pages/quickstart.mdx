# Quickstart


**NOTE: This quickstart is currently being updated.**

This quickstart outlines how to deploy the appropriate contracts for resolving an ENS domain from one of our supported [chains](./chains).

## 1. Initial setup

Run these commands: 

```bash
mkdir quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
forge install https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways
mkdir contracts
```

## 2. Create a `foundry.toml`

- Add the following configuration.

```bash
[profile.default]
src = "contracts"
libs = ["lib"]
solc = "0.8.25"


remappings = [
    "@unruggable=lib/unruggable-gateways/"
]
```

## 2. Deploy a data contract to L2

- Create a file in your `contracts` directory called `L2DataContract.sol`
- Copy the code below.
- Replace `YOUR-ADDRESS-HERE` with your desired resolution address.
- Save the file.

**Contract code**

```solidity filename="L2DataContract.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

contract L2DataContract {
    address slot0 = YOUR-ADDRESS-HERE;
}
```

- Replace `CHAIN-IDENTIFIER` the the appropriate Alchemy subdomain for the L2 rollup you want to deploy to.
- Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your Alchemy API key.
- Replace `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` with your deployment private key.
- Run the command.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://CHAIN-IDENTIFIER.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY --private-key YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY contracts/L2DataContract.sol:L2DataContract
```

## 3. Deploy a resolver to L1

- Create a file in your `contracts` directory called `L1SimpleResolver.sol`
- Copy the code below.
- Save the file.

```solidity filename="L1SimpleResolver.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
 
import  "@unruggable/contracts/GatewayProtocol.sol";
import {GatewayFetcher, GatewayRequest} from "@unruggable/contracts/GatewayFetcher.sol";
import {GatewayFetchTarget, IGatewayProofVerifier} from "@unruggable/contracts/GatewayFetchTarget.sol";

import "forge-std/console2.sol"; // DEBUG

contract L1SimpleResolver is GatewayFetchTarget {
	using GatewayFetcher for GatewayRequest;

	IGatewayProofVerifier immutable _verifier;
	address immutable _exampleAddress;

	constructor(IGatewayProofVerifier verifier, address exampleAddress) {
		_verifier = verifier;
        _exampleAddress = exampleAddress;
	}

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 x) external pure returns (bool) {
		return x == 0x3b3b57de; //See https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/1
	}

    function addr(bytes32 node) public view returns (address) {

        GatewayRequest memory r = GatewayFetcher
            .newRequest(1)
            .setTarget(_exampleAddress)
            .setSlot(11)
            .read()
            .debug("lol")
            .setOutput(0);

		fetch(_verifier, r, this.addrCallback.selector, '');    
	}
	
    function addrCallback(bytes[] calldata values, uint8, bytes calldata extraData) external pure returns (address) {
        return abi.decode(values[0], (address));
	}
}
```

- Replace `VERIFIER-ADDRESS` with the verifier address for your chosen L2. This can be found [here](/verifier-deployments).
- Replace `THE-ADDRESS-OF-THE-CONTRACT-YOU-DEPLOYED-IN-THE-LAST-STEP` with.. you guessed it ;)
- Run the command.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY --private-key YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY contracts/L1SimpleResolver.sol:L1SimpleResolver --constructor-args VERIFIER-ADDRESS THE-ADDRESS-OF-THE-CONTRACT-YOU-DEPLOYED-IN-THE-LAST-STEP
```

## 4. Set your resolver

Set the resolver for your ENS name to the address of the deployed L1 Resolver.

You can do this through the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains/) 

![Update resolver using the ENS App](/images/docs/update-resolver-ens-app.png)

Alternatively you can use the following command having replaced the placeholders.

```bash
cast send 0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e "setResolver(bytes32,address)" $(cast namehash "MY-ENS-NAME") RESOLVER-ADDRESS --private-key YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY --rpc-url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY
```

## 5. Verify

- Verify that your name resolves as expected.

<div class = "warning mt-20">
	<p>**!!** The finalization times for rollup state varies on a chain by chain basis.</p> 
	<p>**!!** Your name **will not resolve** until the data is finalized.</p>
</div>

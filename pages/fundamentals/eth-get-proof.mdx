# `eth_getProof`

The proof returned by `eth_getProof` RPC call consists of several components:

1. **`accountProof`**: 
   - An array of rlp-serialized MerkleTree-Nodes
   - Proves the inclusion of the queried account in the state trie

2. **`balance`**: 
   - The balance of the account at the specified block

3. **`codeHash`**: 
   - The hash of the code of the account at the specified block
   - `0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470` for non-contract accounts

4. **`nonce`**: 
   - The transaction count of the account at the specified block

5. **`storageHash`**: 
   - The hash of the storage trie root of the account

6. **`storageProof`**: 
   - An array of storage-entries as requested
   - Each entry contains:
     - `key`: The requested storage key
     - `value`: The storage value
     - `proof`: An array of rlp-serialized MerkleTree-Nodes proving the inclusion of the storage value

This proof allows verification of account and storage data without needing the entire state trie. It's particularly useful for light clients and cross-chain interactions.

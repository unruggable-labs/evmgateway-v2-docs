# L2 state root commitments

Some L2s (for example [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) and [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)) periodically commit their state root to the Ethereum mainnet (L1). This root represents the entire L2 state.

By anchoring their state roots on L1, L2s can inherit Ethereum's security.

L2s can process many transactions and only need to commit the final state root to L1. This significantly reduces L1 gas costs.

Users can then verify inclusion proofs of L2 state by verifying their inclusion in the Merkle trie represented by the state roots posted on Ethereum mainnet.

## Rollup addresses

The (mainnet) rollup contracts for a number of popular L2s (as of July 3rd 2024) are listed below:

# State roots

An Ethereum state root is a crucial component of Ethereum's blockchain architecture.

1. **Definition**: It's a 256-bit hash that represents the entire state of the Ethereum network at a specific block.

2. **Purpose**: The state root acts as a cryptographic summary of all accounts, balances, contract code, and storage on the Ethereum network.

3. **Merkle Patricia Trie**: It's the root hash of a special data structure called a Merkle Patricia Trie, which efficiently stores all state information.

4. **Integrity**: It allows for quick verification of the entire state without needing to download and process all data.

5. **Block headers**: Each Ethereum block contains a state root, ensuring consensus on the network's state.

6. **Lightweight clients**: Enables light clients to verify transactions without storing the entire blockchain.

7. **State transitions**: When transactions are processed, they modify the state, resulting in a new state root for the next block.

This mechanism is fundamental to Ethereum's ability to maintain a secure and verifiable record of all accounts and transactions.

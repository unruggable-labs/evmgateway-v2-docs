# Chains

We currently support a number of blockchains and are open [to supporting more](/contributing). 

The pages that follow give a basic overview of the chains in question and outline specific implementation details in the context of our [Architecture](/architecture).

We support both Optimistic Rollups ([Arbitrum](/chains/arbitrum), [Optimism](/chains/optimism), [Base](/chains/base)) and Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollups ([Linea](/chains/linea), [Scroll](/chains/scroll), [Taiko](/chains/taiko), [zkSync](/chains/zksync)).

The main differentiator of these two chain types (as it relates to proving data sourced from them) is that: 

- Optimistic rollups post state roots to Layer 1 that are subject to contest in line with chain specific dispute/fault proofing mechanisms.
- ZK chains post Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to Layer 1 which allow for the verification of the correctness of transaction execution without the need to re-execute all of them. Once verification has taken place on Layer 1 the associated updated state roots are finalised and **not** subject to change/dispute.

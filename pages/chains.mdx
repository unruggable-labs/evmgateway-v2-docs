# Chain support

We currently support several rollups and are open to [supporting more](/contributing).

The following pages provide an overview of these chains and explain specific implementation details in the context of our [Architecture](/architecture).

We support both Optimistic Rollups ([Arbitrum](/chains/arbitrum), [Optimism](/chains/optimism), [Base](/chains/base)) and Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollups ([Linea](/chains/linea), [Scroll](/chains/scroll), [Taiko](/chains/taiko), [zkSync](/chains/zksync)).

The key difference between these two types of chains is:

- **Optimistic Rollups**: They post state roots to Layer 1 (L1) that can be contested based on chain-specific dispute or fault-proof mechanisms.
- **ZK Rollups**: They post Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to L1, which verify the correctness of transaction execution without re-executing all transactions. Once verified on L1, the updated state roots are finalized and **cannot** be disputed or changed.

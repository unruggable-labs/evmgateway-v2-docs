## Summary

[Base](https://www.base.org/) is an Optimistic L2 rollup built by [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) on top of the OP Stack. Base **does not** implement the OP Stack [fault proof system](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/fault-proofs/explainer) at this time and as such verification of data is handled in a different manner to that of [Optimism](/chains/optimism).

## High level overview

Base (OP Stack) is EVM compatible and implements its account and storage tries using your standard Patricia Merkle Trie. We verify the returned proofs using the `SecureMerkleTrie.sol` library.

### Context

The [context](/architecture#context) of the request is the `latestOutputIndex` queried from the `L2OutputOracle` contract.

State roots can only be proposed to the `L2OutputOracle` by an access controlled `proposer`.

### Commit 

The commit data for Base is discerned by calling `getL2Output` on the `L2OutputOracle`. 

The `OutputRootProof` is [defined by Optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/5a5dd8f44161e8e05093d92b32e102eb38fe78b6/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/libraries/Types.sol#L25-L30) as:

```
    struct OutputRootProof {
        bytes32 version;
        bytes32 stateRoot;
        bytes32 messagePasserStorageRoot;
        bytes32 latestBlockhash;
    }
```

The gateway returns this data alongside individual account/storage proofs for the requested data. We discern that the `OutputRootProof` for the `latestOutputIndex` matches data stored on L1 and then we verify the proofs returned against the associated state root.

### Verification

The Unruggable gateway Typescript prover implementation used for OP Stack based chains is `EthProver.ts`. 

Base (OP Stack) utilises the same Patricia Merkle Trie structure as Layer 1 Ethereum for its storage and account tries. As such proof verification utilises SecureMerkleTrie.sol by proxy of our EthTrieHooks.sol library.

## High level overview


### Context

The context used is returned from the `latestConfirmed()` method of the Arbitrum rollup contract. The integer returned is the ID of the latest confirmed `RBlock` which represents a batch of transactions or state transitions that are bundled together and committed to the Ethereum blockchain.

### Commit

Arbitrum has a fully implemented fault proof system so it is not neccesarily the case that a `RBlock` posted to L1 is verified and finalised. 

The commit body contains the RLP encoded block data as well as the `sendRoot` (The Merkle root of the outbox tree state) for the RBlock in context.

This process is outlined in the Arbitrum documentation: [How can I verify that an L2 block has been processed as part of a specific RBlock?](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/troubleshooting-building#how-can-i-verify-that-an-l2-block-has-been-processed-as-part-of-a-specific-rblock)

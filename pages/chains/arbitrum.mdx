### Summary

[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io) is an EVM compatible Optimistic rollup.

- [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) is its chain explorer.
- The deployment addresses for its smart contract are found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/useful-addresses).
- The gateway and verifier solution developed for the mainnet (Arbitrum One) chain can also be used for other Nitro stack chains (including AnyTrust and [Orbit](https://arbitrum.foundation/orbit) chains).

## High level overview

The Arbitrum [rollup contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35) is called by the [`ValidatorWallet`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5bc5fb83950bbbf156e433c5c098bfe533db4021#code) (e.g. [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e59bdd3b71efda371dcb61ddeb75420c85766fe87d69b76ce73aa24db659da3#eventlog)) to update the latest created and committed nodes.

Arbitrum has a fully implemented disection based dispute resolution process refereed by an L1 contract. It is not neccesarily the case that a `RBlock` posted to L1 is verified and finalised, but if the challenge period passes without a dispute being initiated the `RBlock` is considered confirmed.

### Context

The [context](/architecture#context) used is returned from the `latestConfirmed()` method of the Arbitrum rollup contract. The integer returned is the ID of the latest confirmed `RBlock` which represents a batch of transactions or state transitions that are bundled together and committed to Ethereum mainnet.

### Commit

The commit body contains the RLP encoded block data as well as the `sendRoot` (The Merkle root of the outbox tree state) for the latest confirmed `RBlock` (the context).

This process of fetching the `sendRoot` is outlined in the Arbitrum documentation: [How can I verify that an L2 block has been processed as part of a specific RBlock?](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/troubleshooting-building#how-can-i-verify-that-an-l2-block-has-been-processed-as-part-of-a-specific-rblock).

We filter the `NodeCreated` event for the latest confirmed `RBlock`

```solidity
event NodeCreated(
    uint64 indexed nodeNum,
    bytes32 indexed parentNodeHash,
    bytes32 indexed nodeHash,
    bytes32 executionHash,
    Assertion assertion,
    bytes32 afterInboxBatchAcc,
    bytes32 wasmModuleRoot,
    uint256 inboxMaxCount
);
```

The latest L2 `blockHash` and `sendRoot` is contained (heavily nested) in the `RBlock` (`event.args.assertion.afterState.globalState.bytes32Vals`) in the `GlobalState` [struct](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/state/GlobalState.sol#L7) nested in the `Assertion` [struct](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/fbbcef09c95f69decabaced3da683f987902f3e2/src/rollup/Node.sol#L15) emitted with the event.


### Verification

The Unruggable gateway Typescript prover implementation used for Arbitrum Nitro stack chains is `EthProver.ts`. 

The on-chain verification of Nitro proofs is handled by the `NitroVerifier.sol` which fetches the node data from the rollup contract (`getNode`) and verifies that it matches the data returned with the commit.

Arbitrum utilises the same Patricia Merkle Trie structure as Layer 1 Ethereum for its storage and account tries. As such proof verification utilises `SecureMerkleTrie.sol` by proxy of our `EthTrieHooks.sol` library.

# Polygon zkEVM

## Summary

- The Polygon zkEVM chain explorer can be found [here](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/).
- zkEVM publish zk-SNARKs as the validity proofs to state changes (rather than zk-STARKs) to minimize verification gas costs.


### Notes

Whilst designed to allow for multiple 'coordinators' only one is currently operational - the Sequencer.

CDK rollup and validium chains.

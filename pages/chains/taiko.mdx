# Taiko

[Taiko](https://taikoscan.io/) is a zero knowledge (zk) based rollup with full EVM compatability.


## High level overview

The Taiko L1 rollup contract can be found at [`based.taiko.eth`](https://etherscan.io/address/based.taiko.eth).

Taiko is EVM compatible and implements its account and storage tries using your standard Patricia Merkle Trie. We verify the returned proofs using the `SecureMerkleTrie.sol` library. 

The Typescript Prover implementation used by Taiko is `EthProver.ts`. 

### Context

The context used by Taiko is that last synchronised block ID (synonymous with block number).

### Commit

The Taiko commit data contains the `parentHash` returned from a call to `eth_getBlockByNumber`. This is used in the verifier to get the `TransitionState` from the rollup by calling `getTransition`. Proofs are then verified for inclusion against the associated state root.

# Taiko

<img src="/images/chains/taiko.png" alt="Taiko zk-EVM based L2" className="centered-image" />

[Taiko](https://taiko.xyz/) is a zero knowledge (zk) based rollup with full EVM compatability.

- The Taiko L1 rollup contract can be found at [`based.taiko.eth`](https://etherscan.io/address/based.taiko.eth).
- The chain explorer for Taiko is [TaikoScan](https://taikoscan.io/).

## High level overview

Taiko is EVM compatible and implements its account and storage tries using your standard Patricia Merkle Trie. We verify the returned proofs using the `SecureMerkleTrie.sol` library. 


### Context

The context used by Taiko is that last synchronised block ID (synonymous with block number).

### Commit

The Taiko commit data contains the `parentHash` returned from a call to `eth_getBlockByNumber`. This is used in the verifier to get the `TransitionState` from the rollup by calling `getTransition`. Proofs are then verified for inclusion against the associated state root.

### Verification

The Unruggable gateway Typescript prover implementation used for Taiko is `EthProver.ts`.

## Introduction

The [Unruggable](https://unruggable.com) EVM Gateway is an [open source codebase](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) offering an end to end solution for resolving data from EVM compatible blockchains whilst inheriting the security guarantees of Layer 1 Ethereum mainnet.

The core elements of the solution are:
   ### A typescript HTTP gateway service.
   
   The gateway interfaces with the appropriate blockchain to source data, generate proofs and return them to the interfacing client.

   This removes the need for users or clients to have to directly interface with a potentially inifinite number of chains.

   ### A series of verifier contracts for verifying L2 state on L1.
   
   A number of verifier contracts are provided out of the box. We currently support Arbitrum, Optimism, and Scroll.
   
   These verifiers interface with the rollup contracts of the specific chains on L1 to verify merkle inclusion proofs against known state roots.

   They give consideration to the security and fraud proofing mechanisms of the respective blockchains.

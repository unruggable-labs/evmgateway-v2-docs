# Verifier Deployments

Verifiers are deployed on Layer 1 Ethereum Mainnet.

The entry point for each verifier is a [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy). 

The verifier implementations access configuration data stored at the proxy level. This pattern allows us to deploy verifiers in a cost effective manner for chains whereby the verification process is the same but configuration differs. For example [Arbitrum](/chains/arbitrum) Orbit chains can all utilize one verifier implementation as can [Optimism](/chains/optimism) Superchains.

## Current Deployments

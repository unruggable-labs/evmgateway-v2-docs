### Getting Started

The [v2 EVMGateway codebase](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) consists of both a [Typescript](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/src/vm.ts) and a [Solidity](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/contracts/EVMProver.sol) implementation of the virtual machine.

The premise is that one can develop the appropriate syntax for reading data from their chosen L2 using Typescript and then simply port it to Solidity (as is) and deploy.

This documentation details the solution [architecture](/architecture), offers an overview of the [virtual machine](/virtual-machine), and a number of [examples](/examples). Those links are a great place to start !

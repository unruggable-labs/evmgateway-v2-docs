### Getting Started

The [v2 EVMGateway codebase](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) consists of both a [Typescript](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/src/vm.ts) and a [Solidity](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/contracts/EVMProver.sol) implementation of the virtual machine.

The premise is that one can develop the appropriate syntax for the data values that they want to read using Typescript and then simply port it to Solidity (as is) and deploy.

This documentation offers a number of pieces of example code. A good starting point is: [Reading value types](/examples/reading-value-types).

The repository also offers a series of examples.
From the `v2` subdirectory the following command can be run: `bun test test/examples/docs/examples.test.ts`.

This will run the tests in [example.test.ts](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/blob/main/v2/test/examples/docs/examples.test.ts) which outline how to build requests for common use cases.

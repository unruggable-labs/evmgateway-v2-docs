## Introduction

The EVM Gateway is an [open-source project](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) that provides a complete solution for fetching data from EVM-compatible blockchains through contracts deployed on Layer 1 Ethereum mainnet.

This documentation provides:

- An overview of the solutionâ€™s [architecture](/architecture)
- Details about the [virtual machine](/virtual-machine)
- Several [examples](/examples) to help you get started

The codebase is designed to be flexible so it can work with new blockchains in the future.

## Features

The codebase offers a simple public API and a flexible internal virtual machine.

Key features of the solution include:
- Support for multiple targets
- In request data manipulation (keccak256, slicing etc)
- Nested request evaluation (for complex data architectures e.g. the proposed ENS v2 specification)

If you have a use case that is not supported, please [get in touch](https://unruggable.com/contact) and/or consider [contributing](/contributing).

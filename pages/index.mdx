## Introduction

The EVM Gateway is an [open source codebase](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/evmgateway-v2/tree/main/v2) offering an end to end solution for resolving data from EVM compatible blockchains whilst inheriting the security guarantees of Layer 1 Ethereum mainnet.

The core elements of the solution are outlined in our [Architecture](/architecture) section.


## Motivations

The v2 of the codebase offers a clear concise public API to a flexible internal stack based virtual machine that caters for the more complex use cases that we have seen when working with smart contracts.

The solution offers (amongst other things):
- Multi target support
- In request data manipulation (keccak256, slicing etc)
- Nested request evaluation (for complex data architectures e.g. the proposed ENS v2 specification)

If you have a use case that is not supported, please [get in touch](https://unruggable.com/contact) and/or consider [contributing](/contributing).

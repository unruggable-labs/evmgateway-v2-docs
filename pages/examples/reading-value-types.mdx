As outlined in the [solidity storage layout documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html), *"Except for dynamically-sized arrays and mappings (see below), data is stored contiguously item after item starting with the first state variable, which is stored in slot 0."*

As such a contract defining a `uint256` as such:

```solidity filename="Example.sol"
contract X {
    uint256 slot0 = 123;
}
```

can have its value read as follows:

```js filename="example.js"
    new EVMRequest(OUTPUT_COUNT)        //Specify the number of outputs
      .setTarget(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)      //Specify the contract address
      .setSlot(0)                       //Specify the slot number
      .read()                           //Read the value
      .setOutput(0)                     //Set it at output index 0
```

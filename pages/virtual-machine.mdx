# Virtual Machine

Our stack-based virtual machine is designed to read data from EVM-compatible rollups and generate proofs to verify that the data is correct.

## Commands

Inside the virtual machine, there are two main registers:

- **Operations register (`ops`)**: Stores the operations.
- **Inputs register (`inputs`)**: Stores the inputs.

The [OP codes](/op-code-reference) provided by the public API define the operations the virtual machine can perform.

Operations can use inputs from the `inputs` register, work with items on the stack, or handle previously fetched outputs. Most OP codes are used to generate and manipulate storage slot IDs and to process the data within them.

## Requests

A virtual machine request (`GatewayRequest`) specifies how many outputs it expects, and how those outputs should be fetched.

Requests can include additional programs inside them for more complex scenarios.

Evaluation of a request returns:

- **`exitCode`**: A code that shows the exit status, which is handled based on user-defined settings.
- **`outputs`**: An array of the requested outputs.

## Internal State

The virtual machine keeps track of several pieces of internal state:

- **`target`**: The contract we are currently fetching data from.
- **`slot`**: The storage slot ID where we are fetching data.
- **`stack`**: The VM stack, which helps manage execution states and data in an organized way.

In the Typescript version, this state is managed by the `MachineState` class in `vm.ts`. In the Solidity version, it is represented by the `Machine` struct in `GatewayProver.sol`.
